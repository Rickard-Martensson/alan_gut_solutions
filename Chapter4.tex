\subsection{One-Dimensional Results}

\exercise
Suppose that $F$ is continous. Compute $P(X_k= X(k), k = 1,2,...n)$, that is, the probability that the original sample is already orderd
\solution
There are $n!$ ways to order the $X_k$ variables, each equaly likely. the probability of be in order is therefore $1/n!$.

\exercise
Suppose that $F$ is continous, and we have a sample of size $n$. We now make one further observation. Compute $P(X_{k:n} = X_{k:n+1})$.
\solution
First look at $k=1$, ie $P(X_{1:n} = X_{1:n+1})$.
This is equal to asking "what is the probability that the $n+1$th sample is the smallest" which is $\frac{1}{n+1}$.

We can imagine looking at the $n+1$ observations, and sorting them.
The probability that the $n+1$th observation being in position $k$ is still $\frac{1}{n+1}$,
so the probability of $X_{n+1}$ being less than $X_{(k)}$ is $\frac{k}{n+1}$.



\exercise
100 numbers are independently and uniformly selected as $X \sim U[0, 1]$ 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item whats the probability that $X_{(100)} < 0.9$
    \item whats the probability that $X_{(2)} > 0.002$
\end{enumerate}

\solution
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(
      F_{(100)}(0.9)^{100} = 0.9^{100} \approx 2.65 10^{-5}  
    \)
    \item Lets split it up into two disjoint cases. \[
      P(X_{(2)} > 0.002) = P(X_{(2)} > 0.002, X_{(1)} >0.002) +  P(X_{(2)} > 0.002, X_{(1)} <0.002)
    = P(X_{(1)} >0.002) + P()
      \]

    Which is equal to \[
      0.998^{100} + {100\choose 1}0.002^1 0.998^{99}  \approx 0.982
    \]
    
\end{enumerate}
